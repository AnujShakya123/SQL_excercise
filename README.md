Overview

This project contains SQL queries designed to analyze and manage data in a healthcare database system. The primary focus is on extracting insights and resolving issues related to doctors, admissions, and patient records. Each query addresses specific use cases, such as identifying doctors with or without admissions, finding incomplete patient records, and other operational tasks.

Key Use Cases

Retrieve details of doctors associated with admissions.

Identify doctors with no associated admissions.

Locate patients whose admissions are incomplete due to missing doctor details.

Additional queries as required by healthcare operations.

Design Decisions and Approach

Query Optimization: The queries leverage JOIN operations and filtering techniques to ensure efficient data retrieval from relational tables.

Data Integrity: Care is taken to identify and handle missing or inconsistent data, such as incomplete doctor or patient records.

Readability: The SQL code is structured for clarity and maintainability, using standard conventions and avoiding overly complex constructs.

Steps to Execute

Database Setup: Ensure the healthcare database is configured and accessible. Import all relevant tables such as Doctors, Admissions, and Patients with the correct schema.

SQL Environment: Use a SQL execution environment such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any other compatible database management system.

Run Queries: Copy and paste each query from the SQL file into your SQL client and execute it.

Ensure that required indexes are in place for optimal performance.

Verify Outputs: Cross-check the results against expected outputs or sample data to validate the correctness of the queries.
